# Announcement tips for the xCodex TUI.
# Each [[announcements]] entry is evaluated in order; the last matching one is shown.
# Dates are UTC, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. `from_date` is inclusive and `to_date` is exclusive.
# `version_regex` matches against the CLI version (env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")); omit to apply to all versions.
# `target_app` selects which app should display the announcement (currently "cli").
