# xcodex hooks (automation)

xcodex includes a basic “automation hooks” system: Codex can spawn external programs on a small set of lifecycle events and pass a JSON payload to them.

This is intended for **notifications and integrations** (fire-and-forget). Hooks do not block the run if they fail.

This document is an overview; the authoritative reference is `docs/config.md#hooks`.

Notes on naming:

- This fork installs the binary as `xcodex`.
- Config keys are snake_case (e.g. `hooks.session_start`); payload `"type"` is kebab-case (e.g. `session-start`).

## What you need to use hooks

No additional commands are required.

1. Ensure you have a `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (for `xcodex` with no `CODEX_HOME`, this is `~/.xcodex/config.toml`)
2. Add a `[hooks]` section (examples below)

Notes:

- Hooks are configured in your active Codex home (`$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`).
- `xcodex` uses `$CODEX_HOME` too. When `CODEX_HOME` is unset, `xcodex` defaults to `~/.xcodex` (and upstream `codex` defaults to `~/.codex`), so hooks you configure via xcodex won’t affect upstream codex by default.
- If you *want* to share hooks/config with upstream codex, explicitly set `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex` before running `xcodex`.

If you want to disable all external hooks for a single run, pass `--no-hooks`:

```sh
xcodex --no-hooks
xcodex exec --no-hooks "…"
```

## Quickstart (copy/paste)

See also:

- Hooks gallery: `docs/xcodex/hooks-gallery.md`
- Ready-to-use scripts: `examples/hooks/`

If you prefer scaffolding, run:

```sh
xcodex hooks init
```

That creates a small set of example scripts under `$CODEX_HOME/hooks/` and prints a config snippet you can paste into `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`.

In the interactive TUI, you can type `/hooks` to see a quick reminder of the relevant `xcodex hooks ...` commands and where logs/payloads are written under `$CODEX_HOME`.

1. Copy a script into your Codex home:

```sh
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.xcodex}/hooks"
cp examples/hooks/log_all_jsonl.py "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.xcodex}/hooks/"
```

2. Add a `[hooks]` entry to `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (use an absolute path):

```toml
[hooks]
agent_turn_complete = [["python3", "/absolute/path/to/log_all_jsonl.py"]]
```

3. Test it:

```sh
xcodex hooks test --configured-only
```

That command prints where hook logs and payload files were written under `$CODEX_HOME`.

To inspect your current hook configuration, run:

```sh
xcodex hooks list
```

To print where hook logs and payloads are written, run:

```sh
xcodex hooks paths
```

### Confirm-on-exit while hooks are running

In the interactive TUI, quitting while hooks are still running prompts for confirmation by default.

Toggle with:

```toml
[tui]
confirm_exit_with_running_hooks = false
```

## Testing your hooks

To exercise your configured hook commands without running a full session, use:

```sh
xcodex hooks test
```

This invokes your configured hook command(s) with synthetic payloads for the supported event types and prints a short summary (including where hook logs and payload files were written under `CODEX_HOME`).

Useful flags:

- `--configured-only` to run only events that have hook commands configured.
- `--event <event>` (repeatable) to select specific events, e.g. `--event approval-requested-exec`.
- `--timeout-seconds <n>` to cap how long each hook command is allowed to run.

## Supported events

- `agent_turn_complete`: runs after each completed turn
- `approval_requested`: runs when Codex asks for approval (exec / apply-patch / MCP elicitation)
- `session_start`: runs when a session starts (after `SessionConfigured`)
- `session_end`: runs when a session ends (best-effort during shutdown)
- `model_request_started`: runs immediately before issuing a model request
- `model_response_completed`: runs after a model response completes
- `tool_call_started`: runs when a tool call begins execution
- `tool_call_finished`: runs when a tool call finishes (success/failure/aborted)

Note: `tool_call_started` is emitted when the tool call is dispatched; `duration-ms` in `tool_call_finished` includes any time spent queued behind non-parallel tool calls.

Each hook command receives event JSON on **stdin**.

The payload always includes (at minimum):

- `schema-version`: currently `1`
- `type`: kebab-case event type (for example `agent-turn-complete`, `model-request-started`, `tool-call-finished`)
- `event-id`: unique id for the event
- `timestamp`: RFC3339 timestamp

Notes:

- `cwd` is the relevant working directory for the event. For exec approvals it is the command’s working directory; for most other events it is the session working directory.

## Configuration

Hooks are configured as argv arrays:

Note: hook command paths are treated as literal argv entries (no shell expansion), so prefer absolute paths.

```toml
[hooks]
agent_turn_complete = [
  ["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/turn_complete.py"],
]

approval_requested = [
  ["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/approval.py"],
]
```

### Example: enable all events

```toml
[hooks]
session_start = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
session_end = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
model_request_started = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
model_response_completed = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
tool_call_started = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
tool_call_finished = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
agent_turn_complete = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
approval_requested = [["python3", "/path/to/hook.py"]]
```

### Payload delivery (stdin + file fallback)

For small payloads, Codex writes the full JSON payload to stdin.

For large payloads, Codex writes the full payload JSON to a file under CODEX_HOME and writes a small JSON envelope to stdin containing `payload-path`. Hook scripts should handle both cases.

Payload/log files are kept under CODEX_HOME and pruned with a global keep-last-N policy.
While the TUI is running, hook stdout/stderr are redirected to log files under CODEX_HOME so hooks do not corrupt the terminal UI.

Config knobs:

```toml
[hooks]
# Defaults shown.
max_stdin_payload_bytes = 16384
keep_last_n_payloads = 50
```

## Example: log turn summaries to a file

Create `$CODEX_HOME/hooks/turn_complete.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import os
import pathlib
import sys

stdin_payload = sys.stdin.read()
payload = json.loads(stdin_payload)
payload_path = payload.get("payload-path")
if payload_path:
    payload = json.loads(pathlib.Path(payload_path).read_text())
out = pathlib.Path(os.environ["CODEX_HOME"]) / "hooks.log"
out.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

line = f"{payload.get('type')} cwd={payload.get('cwd')} last={payload.get('last-assistant-message')!r}\n"
out.write_text(out.read_text() + line if out.exists() else line)
```

Then wire it up in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` as shown above.

## Example: log all hook payloads (JSONL)

Create `$CODEX_HOME/hooks/log_all.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import os
import pathlib
import sys

payload = json.loads(sys.stdin.read() or "{}")
payload_path = payload.get("payload-path")
if payload_path:
    payload = json.loads(pathlib.Path(payload_path).read_text())

out = pathlib.Path(os.environ["CODEX_HOME"]) / "hooks.jsonl"
out.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
out.write_text((out.read_text() if out.exists() else "") + json.dumps(payload) + "\n")
```

Then configure:

```toml
[hooks]
session_start = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
session_end = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
model_request_started = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
model_response_completed = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
tool_call_started = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
tool_call_finished = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
agent_turn_complete = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
approval_requested = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.xcodex/hooks/log_all.py"]]
```

## Example: approval notifications

When an approval is requested, the payload includes:

- `kind`: `exec`, `apply-patch`, or `elicitation`
- `command` (for exec approvals)
- `approval-policy` and `sandbox-policy` (for exec + apply-patch approvals)
- `proposed-execpolicy-amendment` (for exec approvals, when available)
- `paths` / `grant-root` (for apply_patch approvals)
- `server-name` / `request-id` / `message` (for MCP elicitation)

Use this to route alerts (macOS notification, Slack webhook, etc.).

## Making hooks easier to adopt (ideas)

To get users using hooks with minimal effort, we could add:

- A `xcodex hooks init` command that writes:
  - `$CODEX_HOME/hooks/` example scripts
  - a commented-out `[hooks]` section in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`
- A `just hooks-install` recipe that installs the examples into `$CODEX_HOME/hooks/`
- A small “marketplace” of prebuilt hook scripts in-repo (loggers, notifiers, memory capture)
- A richer “hooks test” UX (for example, selecting events interactively and previewing payload JSON)

## Avoiding recursion

If a hook script runs `xcodex exec` (for example to do background processing after a turn completes), use `xcodex exec --no-hooks ...` so the child run does not re-trigger hooks.

## `notify` (deprecated)

The legacy `notify` config is deprecated; use `hooks.agent_turn_complete` instead.
