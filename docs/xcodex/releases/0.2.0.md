# Release notes: xcodex v0.2.0

## Highlights

- Hooks system: external hooks, Python Host (“py-box”) hooks, and PyO3 hooks.
- Typed hook SDK installers (Python/Rust/JS/TS/Go/Ruby/Java) + runnable samples.
- Hooks schema + gallery docs.
- Worktrees: `/worktree` for switching between git worktrees (plus shared dirs).
- ⚡Tools: `Ctrl+O` and `/xtreme` for fast access to tools/settings flows.

## Hooks
