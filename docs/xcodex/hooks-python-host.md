# Python Host hooks (long-lived “python box” / “py-box”)

Python Host hooks are a **single long-lived** hook process (“py-box”) that receives hook events over stdin as JSONL.

This is the recommended way to write **stateful Python hooks** without per-event process spawn overhead, and without needing a separately built PyO3-enabled binary.

Key property: the host process is started once and stays up for the session, so you don’t pay “process creation per event”. The sandbox stays in effect for the lifetime of the host.

Event parity: the host receives the same event types as external hooks. Each JSONL line contains an `event` object that matches the external hook payload shape.

## Why “py-box” is high throughput

The host is spawned once (sandboxed), and xcodex keeps an open stdin pipe and streams events as JSONL. Compared to “spawn a Python process per event”, this removes process startup overhead and makes the host feel “in-proc” from a throughput perspective, while still keeping Python out-of-process.

## Use cases

- Maintain in-memory state across events (counters, dedupe, caching, routing rules).
- Do heavier parsing/formatting without paying per-event process startup.
- Send notifications or metrics while keeping a single warm Python process.
- Implement richer automations than “one shell command per event”, while still isolating Python from xcodex itself.

## What is the host script?

The “host script” is a small runner (Python) that:

- reads one JSON object per line from stdin,
- extracts the `event` payload,
- calls your hook function (example: `on_event(event: dict) -> None`),
- writes any stdout/stderr to hook log files while the TUI is running.

The sample installer provides a reference host implementation and an example hook script you can customize.

### Minimal example hook (Python)

The sample installer includes an example hook script. A minimal “log one line per event” hook looks like:

```python
def on_event(event: dict) -> None:
    event_type = event.get("xcodex_event_type")
    tool = event.get("tool_name")
    print(f"{event_type} tool={tool}")
```

## Quickstart (no code required)

1) Install the runnable sample files into your active `CODEX_HOME`:

```sh
xcodex hooks install samples python-host
```

This shows a plan and asks for confirmation before writing files (use `--yes` to skip the prompt).

2) Paste the printed snippet into `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (defaults to `~/.xcodex/config.toml`).

If you want to configure it manually, a minimal example looks like:

```toml
[hooks.host]
enabled = true
command = ["python3", "-u", "hooks/host/python/host.py", "hooks/host/python/example_hook.py"]
```

3) Test the configured host without running a full session:

```sh
xcodex hooks test python-host --configured-only
```

This spawns your configured `hooks.host.command`, writes a single JSONL hook event to stdin, then closes stdin; the host should exit cleanly on EOF.

4) Verify output:

- The reference example hook appends lines to `CODEX_HOME/hooks-host-tool-calls.log`.
- Host logs go under `CODEX_HOME/tmp/hooks/host/logs/`.

To see paths, run:

```sh
xcodex hooks paths
```

## Where to keep your host + hook scripts

- The sample installer writes files under `CODEX_HOME/hooks/` (for example `hooks/host/python/host.py` and `hooks/host/python/example_hook.py`).
- Your host script and hook scripts are **not required** to live in `CODEX_HOME`. Absolute paths work fine.
- The host process is spawned with `cwd=CODEX_HOME`, so relative paths in `hooks.host.command` are resolved from `CODEX_HOME`.

## Choosing your Python version

xcodex does not manage Python versions for the host. You choose the interpreter by setting the first argv entry in `hooks.host.command`, for example:

```toml
[hooks.host]
enabled = true
command = ["python3.12", "-u", "hooks/host/python/host.py", "hooks/host/python/example_hook.py"]
```

Notes:

- `hooks.host.command` is argv (no shell expansion).
- The host process is spawned with `cwd=CODEX_HOME`, so relative paths in the argv are resolved from `CODEX_HOME`.

## Command summary

- `xcodex hooks init python-host`
- `xcodex hooks install samples python-host [--dry-run] [--force] [--yes]`
- `xcodex hooks doctor python-host`
- `xcodex hooks test python-host [--timeout-seconds N] [--configured-only]`
- `xcodex hooks paths`

## TUI / TUI2

Inside the interactive TUI/TUI2 you can run:

```text
/hooks init
/hooks install samples python-host --yes
```

## Contributor checks

```sh
cd codex-rs
cargo test -p codex-cli --test hooks
cargo test -p codex-core hooks::tests::hook_host_receives_events
```

Optional (requires Docker for the template smoke test):

```sh
cd codex-rs
just hooks-codegen-check
just hooks-templates-smoke
```
