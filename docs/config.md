# Configuration

For basic configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

For advanced configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced).

For a full configuration reference, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

## Connecting to MCP servers

Codex can connect to MCP servers configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`. See the configuration reference for the latest MCP server options:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

## Ignore files

Codex supports repo-local ignore files (gitignore-style) to exclude paths from discovery/search/context building:

- `.aiexclude`
- `.xcodexignore`

Matches are omitted from file search and directory listings, and structured file tools refuse to read them.

See `docs/xcodex/ignore-files.md` for details and examples.

MCP note: MCP servers may run outside Codex's sandbox. Use `unattested_output_policy` to control whether unattested MCP output is forwarded to the model.

## Exclusion (sensitive-path controls)

The `[exclusion]` config table controls both:

- Which repo-root ignore files are loaded.
- How Codex redacts/blocks ignored path mentions and common secret patterns before sending content to the model.

Example:

```toml
[exclusion]
enabled = true
paranoid_mode = false
path_matching = true
content_hashing = true
substring_matching = true
secret_patterns = true
secret_patterns_builtin = true
secret_patterns_allowlist = []
secret_patterns_blocklist = []
on_match = "redact"  # warn|block|redact
log_redactions = "off" # off|summary|raw
log_redactions_max_bytes = 52428800
log_redactions_max_files = 2
show_summary_banner = true
show_summary_history = true
preflight_shell_paths = true
files = [".aiexclude", ".xcodexignore"]
```

Defaults:

- `enabled = true`
- `path_matching = true`, `content_hashing = true`, `substring_matching = true`, `secret_patterns = true`
- `paranoid_mode = false` (only Layer 1 + Layer 3 are enforced by default; see below)
- `show_summary_banner = true`, `show_summary_history = true` (both are UI-only; no paths are ever shown)
- `preflight_shell_paths = true` (blocks shell tool calls that reference excluded paths before executing)

When `log_redactions` is enabled, Codex appends redaction details to `CODEX_HOME/log/exclusion-redactions.jsonl` (including a `reasons` array like `ignored_path`, `secret_pattern`, `fingerprint_cache`). `summary` writes redacted context only; `raw` includes original + sanitized context.

Secret-pattern customization:

- `secret_patterns_builtin = true|false` toggles the built-in regex set.
- `secret_patterns_allowlist = ["..."]` adds regexes to the built-ins.
- `secret_patterns_blocklist = ["..."]` suppresses matches from built-ins and the allowlist.

Layer toggles:

- Layer 1 (Input guards / deny-read for structured tools): controlled by `path_matching`.
- Layer 2 (Output sanitization): controlled by `layer_output_sanitization` (defaults to `paranoid_mode`).
- Layer 3 (Send firewall): controlled by `layer_send_firewall` (defaults to `true`).
- Layer 4 (Request interceptor): controlled by `layer_request_interceptor` (defaults to `paranoid_mode`).

If you set `paranoid_mode = true`, Codex enables Layer 2 and Layer 4 by default. You can still override any layer individually:

```toml
[exclusion]
paranoid_mode = true
layer_output_sanitization = false
layer_request_interceptor = true
```

## Themes

Codex TUIs support theming via xcodex-native YAML theme files.

### Theme selection

Theme selection is configured under the `[themes]` table in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[themes]
# Optional directory containing `*.yml` / `*.yaml` theme files.
# Defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/themes`.
dir = "/path/to/themes"

# auto|light|dark (default: auto)
theme_mode = "auto"

# Theme names for each variant (default: "default").
light = "example-light"
dark = "example-dark"
```

Codex ships with a built-in theme catalog, so `/theme` and the config above work even when `themes.dir` is empty. Some built-in theme names:

- `default`
- `dracula`
- `gruvbox-dark`
- `nord`
- `solarized-dark`
- `solarized-light`

The full built-in catalog is intentionally not listed here; use `/theme` to browse.

Any `*.yml` / `*.yaml` files found in `themes.dir` are merged into the catalog and can override a built-in theme by reusing its `name`.

You can also select themes interactively from inside the TUI:

- `/theme` opens the picker with a live preview.
- `Ctrl+T` toggles edit mode inside `/theme` (palette/roles + live preview + save-as flow).
- `/theme help` explains `roles.*` vs `palette.*`.
- `/theme template` writes example YAML files into `themes.dir` (or `$CODEX_HOME/themes`).

### Theme file format

Theme files are YAML with:

- `name`: string (used for selection)
- `variant`: `light` or `dark`
- `palette.*`: 16 ANSI palette slots
- `roles.*`: semantic UI roles used by the TUI

Common `roles.*` keys:

- `roles.fg` / `roles.bg`: primary app text + surfaces
- `roles.transcript_bg` / `roles.composer_bg` / `roles.status_bg`: transcript, composer, and status bar backgrounds (optional; derived from `roles.fg/bg` by default)
- `roles.status_ramp_fg` / `roles.status_ramp_highlight`: ramp text base + shimmer highlight for status headers (optional)
- `roles.user_prompt_highlight_bg`: background for highlighting past user prompts in the transcript (optional; derived from composer by default)
- `roles.selection_fg` / `roles.selection_bg`: selection highlight in pickers
- `roles.border`: box borders and chrome
- `roles.command`: command-ish labels and command identifiers (defaults to `palette.magenta`)
- `roles.dim`: derived from `roles.fg/bg` (no YAML key)

See `docs/themes/example-dark.yaml` and `docs/themes/example-light.yaml` for reference.

## Notify

Codex can run a notification hook when the agent finishes a turn. See the configuration reference for the latest notification settings:

```toml
[features]
web_search_request = true        # allow the model to request web searches
# view_image_tool defaults to true; omit to keep defaults
```

Supported features:

| Key                                   | Default | Stage        | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | :-----: | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `unified_exec`                        |  false  | Experimental | Use the unified PTY-backed exec tool                  |
| `apply_patch_freeform`                |  false  | Beta         | Include the freeform `apply_patch` tool               |
| `view_image_tool`                     |  true   | Stable       | Include the `view_image` tool                         |
| `web_search_request`                  |  false  | Stable       | Allow the model to issue web searches                 |
| `enable_experimental_windows_sandbox` |  false  | Experimental | Use the Windows restricted-token sandbox              |
| `tui2`                                |  false  | Experimental | Use the experimental TUI v2 (viewport) implementation |
| `skills`                              |  false  | Experimental | Enable discovery and injection of skills              |

Notes:

- Omit a key to accept its default.
- Legacy booleans such as `experimental_use_exec_command_tool`, `experimental_use_unified_exec_tool`, `include_apply_patch_tool`, and similar `experimental_use_*` keys are deprecated; setting the corresponding `[features].<key>` avoids repeated warnings.

## Model selection

### model

The model that Codex should use.

```toml
model = "gpt-5.1"  # overrides the default ("gpt-5.1-codex-max" across platforms)
```

### model_providers

This option lets you add to the default set of model providers bundled with Codex. The map key becomes the value you use with `model_provider` to select the provider.

> [!NOTE]
> Built-in providers are not overwritten when you reuse their key. Entries you add only take effect when the key is **new**; for example `[model_providers.openai]` leaves the original OpenAI definition untouched. To customize the bundled OpenAI provider, prefer the dedicated knobs (for example the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable) or register a new provider key and point `model_provider` at it.

For example, if you wanted to add a provider that uses the OpenAI 4o model via the chat completions API, then you could add the following configuration:

```toml
# Recall that in TOML, root keys must be listed before tables.
model = "gpt-4o"
model_provider = "openai-chat-completions"

[model_providers.openai-chat-completions]
# Name of the provider that will be displayed in the Codex UI.
name = "OpenAI using Chat Completions"
# The path `/chat/completions` will be amended to this URL to make the POST
# request for the chat completions.
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
# If `env_key` is set, identifies an environment variable that must be set when
# using Codex with this provider. The value of the environment variable must be
# non-empty and will be used in the `Bearer TOKEN` HTTP header for the POST request.
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
# Valid values for wire_api are "chat" and "responses". Defaults to "chat" if omitted.
wire_api = "chat"
# If necessary, extra query params that need to be added to the URL.
# See the Azure example below.
query_params = {}
```

Note this makes it possible to use Codex CLI with non-OpenAI models, so long as they use a wire API that is compatible with the OpenAI chat completions API. For example, you could define the following provider to use Codex CLI with Ollama running locally:

```toml
[model_providers.ollama]
name = "Ollama"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
```

Or a third-party provider (using a distinct environment variable for the API key):

```toml
[model_providers.mistral]
name = "Mistral"
base_url = "https://api.mistral.ai/v1"
env_key = "MISTRAL_API_KEY"
```

It is also possible to configure a provider to include extra HTTP headers with a request. These can be hardcoded values (`http_headers`) or values read from environment variables (`env_http_headers`):

```toml
[model_providers.example]
# name, base_url, ...

# This will add the HTTP header `X-Example-Header` with value `example-value`
# to each request to the model provider.
http_headers = { "X-Example-Header" = "example-value" }

# This will add the HTTP header `X-Example-Features` with the value of the
# `EXAMPLE_FEATURES` environment variable to each request to the model provider
# _if_ the environment variable is set and its value is non-empty.
env_http_headers = { "X-Example-Features" = "EXAMPLE_FEATURES" }
```

#### Azure model provider example

Note that Azure requires `api-version` to be passed as a query parameter, so be sure to specify it as part of `query_params` when defining the Azure provider:

```toml
[model_providers.azure]
name = "Azure"
# Make sure you set the appropriate subdomain for this URL.
base_url = "https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai"
env_key = "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"  # Or "OPENAI_API_KEY", whichever you use.
query_params = { api-version = "2025-04-01-preview" }
wire_api = "responses"
```

Export your key before launching Codex: `export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=…`

#### Per-provider network tuning

The following optional settings control retry behaviour and streaming idle timeouts **per model provider**. They must be specified inside the corresponding `[model_providers.<id>]` block in `config.toml`. (Older releases accepted top‑level keys; those are now ignored.)

Example:

```toml
[model_providers.openai]
name = "OpenAI"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
# network tuning overrides (all optional; falls back to built‑in defaults)
request_max_retries = 4            # retry failed HTTP requests
stream_max_retries = 10            # retry dropped SSE streams
stream_idle_timeout_ms = 300000    # 5m idle timeout
```

##### request_max_retries

How many times Codex will retry a failed HTTP request to the model provider. Defaults to `4`.

##### stream_max_retries

Number of times Codex will attempt to reconnect when a streaming response is interrupted. Defaults to `5`.

##### stream_idle_timeout_ms

How long Codex will wait for activity on a streaming response before treating the connection as lost. Defaults to `300_000` (5 minutes).

### model_provider

Identifies which provider to use from the `model_providers` map. Defaults to `"openai"`. You can override the `base_url` for the built-in `openai` provider via the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable.

Note that if you override `model_provider`, then you likely want to override
`model`, as well. For example, if you are running ollama with Mistral locally,
then you would need to add the following to your config in addition to the new entry in the `model_providers` map:

```toml
model_provider = "ollama"
model = "mistral"
```

### model_reasoning_effort

If the selected model is known to support reasoning (for example: `o3`, `o4-mini`, `codex-*`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.2`), reasoning is enabled by default when using the Responses API. As explained in the [OpenAI Platform documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?api-mode=responses#get-started-with-reasoning), this can be set to:

- `"minimal"`
- `"low"`
- `"medium"` (default)
- `"high"`
- `"xhigh"` (available on `gpt-5.1-codex-max` and `gpt-5.2`)

Note: to minimize reasoning, choose `"minimal"`.

### model_reasoning_summary

If the model name starts with `"o"` (as in `"o3"` or `"o4-mini"`) or `"codex"`, reasoning is enabled by default when using the Responses API. As explained in the [OpenAI Platform documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?api-mode=responses#reasoning-summaries), this can be set to:

- `"auto"` (default)
- `"concise"`
- `"detailed"`

To disable reasoning summaries, set `model_reasoning_summary` to `"none"` in your config:

```toml
model_reasoning_summary = "none"  # disable reasoning summaries
```

### model_verbosity

Controls output length/detail on GPT‑5 family models when using the Responses API. Supported values:

- `"low"`
- `"medium"` (default when omitted)
- `"high"`

When set, Codex includes a `text` object in the request payload with the configured verbosity, for example: `"text": { "verbosity": "low" }`.

Example:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.1"
model_verbosity = "low"
```

Note: This applies only to providers using the Responses API. Chat Completions providers are unaffected.

### model_supports_reasoning_summaries

By default, `reasoning` is only set on requests to OpenAI models that are known to support them. To force `reasoning` to set on requests to the current model, you can force this behavior by setting the following in `config.toml`:

```toml
model_supports_reasoning_summaries = true
```

### model_context_window

The size of the context window for the model, in tokens.

In general, Codex knows the context window for the most common OpenAI models, but if you are using a new model with an old version of the Codex CLI, then you can use `model_context_window` to tell Codex what value to use to determine how much context is left during a conversation.

### oss_provider

Specifies the default OSS provider to use when running Codex. This is used when the `--oss` flag is provided without a specific provider.

Valid values are:

- `"lmstudio"` - Use LM Studio as the local model provider
- `"ollama"` - Use Ollama as the local model provider

```toml
# Example: Set default OSS provider to LM Studio
oss_provider = "lmstudio"
```

## Execution environment

### approval_policy

Determines when the user should be prompted to approve whether Codex can execute a command:

```toml
# Codex has hardcoded logic that defines a set of "trusted" commands.
# Setting the approval_policy to `untrusted` means that Codex will prompt the
# user before running a command not in the "trusted" set.
#
# See https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1260 for the plan to enable
# end-users to define their own trusted commands.
approval_policy = "untrusted"
```

If you want to be notified whenever a command fails, use "on-failure":

```toml
# If the command fails when run in the sandbox, Codex asks for permission to
# retry the command outside the sandbox.
approval_policy = "on-failure"
```

If you want the model to run until it decides that it needs to ask you for escalated permissions, use "on-request":

```toml
# The model decides when to escalate
approval_policy = "on-request"
```

Alternatively, you can have the model run until it is done, and never ask to run a command with escalated permissions:

```toml
# User is never prompted: if the command fails, Codex will automatically try
# something out. Note the `exec` subcommand always uses this mode.
approval_policy = "never"
```

### sandbox_mode

Codex executes model-generated shell commands inside an OS-level sandbox.

In most cases you can pick the desired behaviour with a single option:

```toml
# same as `--sandbox read-only`
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
```

The default policy is `read-only`, which means commands can read any file on
disk, but attempts to write a file or access the network will be blocked.

A more relaxed policy is `workspace-write`. When specified, the current working directory for the Codex task will be writable (as well as `$TMPDIR` on macOS). Note that the CLI defaults to using the directory where it was spawned as `cwd`, though this can be overridden using `--cwd/-C`.

On macOS (and soon Linux), all writable roots (including `cwd`) that contain a `.git/` or `.codex/` folder _as an immediate child_ will configure those folders to be read-only while the rest of the root stays writable. This means that commands like `git commit` will fail, by default (as it entails writing to `.git/`), and will require Codex to ask for permission.

```toml
# same as `--sandbox workspace-write`
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

# Extra settings that only apply when `sandbox = "workspace-write"`.
[sandbox_workspace_write]
# By default, the cwd for the Codex session will be writable as well as $TMPDIR
# (if set) and /tmp (if it exists). Setting the respective options to `true`
# will override those defaults.
exclude_tmpdir_env_var = false
exclude_slash_tmp = false

# Optional list of _additional_ writable roots beyond $TMPDIR and /tmp.
writable_roots = ["/Users/YOU/.pyenv/shims"]

# Allow the command being run inside the sandbox to make outbound network
# requests. Disabled by default.
network_access = false
```

To disable sandboxing altogether, specify `danger-full-access` like so:

```toml
# same as `--sandbox danger-full-access`
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
```

This is reasonable to use if Codex is running in an environment that provides its own sandboxing (such as a Docker container) such that further sandboxing is unnecessary.

Though using this option may also be necessary if you try to use Codex in environments where its native sandboxing mechanisms are unsupported, such as older Linux kernels or on Windows.

### tools.\*

These `[tools]` configuration options are deprecated. Use `[features]` instead (see [Feature flags](#feature-flags)).

Use the optional `[tools]` table to toggle built-in tools that the agent may call. `web_search` stays off unless you opt in, while `view_image` is now enabled by default:

```toml
[tools]
web_search = true   # allow Codex to issue first-party web searches without prompting you (deprecated)
view_image = false  # disable image uploads (they're enabled by default)
```

The `view_image` toggle is useful when you want to include screenshots or diagrams from your repo without pasting them manually. Codex still respects sandboxing: it can only attach files inside the workspace roots you allow.

### approval_presets

Codex provides three main Approval Presets:

- Read Only: Codex can read files and answer questions; edits, running commands, and network access require approval.
- Auto: Codex can read files, make edits, and run commands in the workspace without approval; asks for approval outside the workspace or for network access.
- Full Access: Full disk and network access without prompts; extremely risky.

You can further customize how Codex runs at the command line using the `--ask-for-approval` and `--sandbox` options.

> See also [Sandbox & approvals](./sandbox.md) for in-depth examples and platform-specific behaviour.

### shell_environment_policy

Codex spawns subprocesses (e.g. when executing a `local_shell` tool-call suggested by the assistant). By default it now passes **your full environment** to those subprocesses. You can tune this behavior via the **`shell_environment_policy`** block in `config.toml`:

```toml
[shell_environment_policy]
# inherit can be "all" (default), "core", or "none"
inherit = "core"
# set to true to *skip* the filter for `"*KEY*"`, `"*SECRET*"`, and `"*TOKEN*"`
ignore_default_excludes = true
# exclude patterns (case-insensitive globs)
exclude = ["AWS_*", "AZURE_*"]
# force-set / override values
set = { CI = "1" }
# if provided, *only* vars matching these patterns are kept
include_only = ["PATH", "HOME"]
```

| Field                     | Type                 | Default | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inherit`                 | string               | `all`   | Starting template for the environment:<br>`all` (clone full parent env), `core` (`HOME`, `PATH`, `USER`, …), or `none` (start empty).           |
| `ignore_default_excludes` | boolean              | `true`  | When `false`, Codex removes any var whose **name** contains `KEY`, `SECRET`, or `TOKEN` (case-insensitive) before other rules run.              |
| `exclude`                 | array<string>        | `[]`    | Case-insensitive glob patterns to drop after the default filter.<br>Examples: `"AWS_*"`, `"AZURE_*"`.                                           |
| `set`                     | table<string,string> | `{}`    | Explicit key/value overrides or additions – always win over inherited values.                                                                   |
| `include_only`            | array<string>        | `[]`    | If non-empty, a whitelist of patterns; only variables that match _one_ pattern survive the final step. (Generally used with `inherit = "all"`.) |

The patterns are **glob style**, not full regular expressions: `*` matches any
number of characters, `?` matches exactly one, and character classes like
`[A-Z]`/`[^0-9]` are supported. Matching is always **case-insensitive**. This
syntax is documented in code as `EnvironmentVariablePattern` (see
`core/src/config_types.rs`).

If you just need a clean slate with a few custom entries you can write:

```toml
[shell_environment_policy]
inherit = "none"
set = { PATH = "/usr/bin", MY_FLAG = "1" }
```

Currently, `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` is also added to the environment, assuming network is disabled. This is not configurable.

## Project root detection

Codex discovers `.codex/` project layers by walking up from the working directory until it hits a project marker. By default it looks for `.git`. You can override the marker list in user/system/MDM config:

```toml
# $CODEX_HOME/config.toml
project_root_markers = [".git", ".hg", ".sl"]
```

Set `project_root_markers = []` to skip searching parent directories and treat the current working directory as the project root.

## MCP integration

### mcp_servers

You can configure Codex to use [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/about) to give Codex access to external applications, resources, or services.

#### Server configuration

##### STDIO

[STDIO servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio) are MCP servers that you can launch directly via commands on your computer.

```toml
# The top-level table name must be `mcp_servers`
# The sub-table name (`server-name` in this example) can be anything you would like.
[mcp_servers.server_name]
command = "npx"
# Optional
args = ["-y", "mcp-server"]
# Optional: propagate additional env vars to the MCP server.
# A default whitelist of env vars will be propagated to the MCP server.
# https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/rmcp-client/src/utils.rs#L82
env = { "API_KEY" = "value" }
# or
[mcp_servers.server_name.env]
API_KEY = "value"
# Optional: Additional list of environment variables that will be whitelisted in the MCP server's environment.
env_vars = ["API_KEY2"]

# Optional: cwd that the command will be run from
cwd = "/Users/<user>/code/my-server"
```

##### Streamable HTTP

[Streamable HTTP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) enable Codex to talk to resources that are accessed via a http url (either on localhost or another domain).

```toml
[mcp_servers.figma]
url = "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
# Optional environment variable containing a bearer token to use for auth
bearer_token_env_var = "ENV_VAR"
# Optional map of headers with hard-coded values.
http_headers = { "HEADER_NAME" = "HEADER_VALUE" }
# Optional map of headers whose values will be replaced with the environment variable.
env_http_headers = { "HEADER_NAME" = "ENV_VAR" }
```

Streamable HTTP connections always use the Rust MCP client under the hood. Run `codex mcp login <server-name>` to authenticate for servers supporting OAuth.

#### Other configuration options

```toml
# Optional: override the default 10s startup timeout
startup_timeout_sec = 20
# Optional: override the default 60s per-tool timeout
tool_timeout_sec = 30
# Optional: disable a server without removing it
enabled = false
# Optional: only expose a subset of tools from this server
enabled_tools = ["search", "summarize"]
# Optional: hide specific tools (applied after `enabled_tools`, if set)
disabled_tools = ["search"]
```

When both `enabled_tools` and `disabled_tools` are specified, Codex first restricts the server to the allow-list and then removes any tools that appear in the deny-list.

#### MCP CLI commands

```shell
# List all available commands
codex mcp --help

# Add a server (env can be repeated; `--` separates the launcher command)
codex mcp add docs -- docs-server --port 4000

# List configured servers (pretty table or JSON)
codex mcp list
codex mcp list --json

# Show one server (table or JSON)
codex mcp get docs
codex mcp get docs --json

### Examples of useful MCPs

There is an ever growing list of useful MCP servers that can be helpful while you are working with Codex.

Some of the most common MCPs we've seen are:

- [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) — connect to a wide range of up-to-date developer documentation
- Figma [Local](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/local-server-installation/) and [Remote](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/remote-server-installation/) - access to your Figma designs
- [Playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/mcp) - control and inspect a browser using Playwright
- [Chrome Developer Tools](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/) — control and inspect a Chrome browser
- [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/#codex) — access to your Sentry logs
- [GitHub](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) — Control over your GitHub account beyond what git allows (like controlling PRs, issues, etc.)

## Observability and telemetry

### otel

Codex can emit [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) **log events** that
describe each run: outbound API requests, streamed responses, user input,
tool-approval decisions, and the result of every tool invocation. Export is
**disabled by default** so local runs remain self-contained. Opt in by adding an
`[otel]` table and choosing an exporter.

```toml
[otel]
environment = "staging"   # defaults to "dev"
exporter = "none"          # defaults to "none"; set to otlp-http or otlp-grpc to send events
log_user_prompt = false    # defaults to false; redact prompt text unless explicitly enabled
```

Codex tags every exported event with `service.name = $ORIGINATOR` (the same
value sent in the `originator` header, `codex_cli_rs` by default), the CLI
version, and an `env` attribute so downstream collectors can distinguish
dev/staging/prod traffic. Only telemetry produced inside the `codex_otel`
crate—the events listed below—is forwarded to the exporter.

### Event catalog

Every event shares a common set of metadata fields: `event.timestamp`,
`conversation.id`, `app.version`, `auth_mode` (when available),
`user.account_id` (when available), `user.email` (when available), `terminal.type`, `model`, and `slug`.

With OTEL enabled Codex emits the following event types (in addition to the
metadata above):

- `codex.conversation_starts`
  - `provider_name`
  - `reasoning_effort` (optional)
  - `reasoning_summary`
  - `context_window` (optional)
  - `max_output_tokens` (optional)
  - `auto_compact_token_limit` (optional)
  - `approval_policy`
  - `sandbox_policy`
  - `mcp_servers` (comma-separated list)
  - `active_profile` (optional)
- `codex.api_request`
  - `attempt`
  - `duration_ms`
  - `http.response.status_code` (optional)
  - `error.message` (failures)
- `codex.sse_event`
  - `event.kind`
  - `duration_ms`
  - `error.message` (failures)
  - `input_token_count` (responses only)
  - `output_token_count` (responses only)
  - `cached_token_count` (responses only, optional)
  - `reasoning_token_count` (responses only, optional)
  - `tool_token_count` (responses only)
- `codex.user_prompt`
  - `prompt_length`
  - `prompt` (redacted unless `log_user_prompt = true`)
- `codex.tool_decision`
  - `tool_name`
  - `call_id`
  - `decision` (`approved`, `approved_execpolicy_amendment`, `approved_for_session`, `denied`, or `abort`)
  - `source` (`config` or `user`)
- `codex.tool_result`
  - `tool_name`
  - `call_id` (optional)
  - `arguments` (optional)
  - `duration_ms` (execution time for the tool)
  - `success` (`"true"` or `"false"`)
  - `output`

These event shapes may change as we iterate.

### Choosing an exporter

Set `otel.exporter` to control where events go:

- `none` – leaves instrumentation active but skips exporting. This is the
  default.
- `otlp-http` – posts OTLP log records to an OTLP/HTTP collector. Specify the
  endpoint, protocol, and headers your collector expects:

  ```toml
  [otel.exporter."otlp-http"]
  endpoint = "https://otel.example.com/v1/logs"
  protocol = "binary"

  [otel.exporter."otlp-http".headers]
  "x-otlp-api-key" = "${OTLP_TOKEN}"
  ```

- `otlp-grpc` – streams OTLP log records over gRPC. Provide the endpoint and any
  metadata headers:

  ```toml
  [otel]
  exporter = { otlp-grpc = {endpoint = "https://otel.example.com:4317",headers = { "x-otlp-meta" = "abc123" }}}
  ```

Both OTLP exporters accept an optional `tls` block so you can trust a custom CA
or enable mutual TLS. Relative paths are resolved against `~/.codex/`:

```toml
[otel.exporter."otlp-http"]
endpoint = "https://otel.example.com/v1/logs"
protocol = "binary"

[otel.exporter."otlp-http".headers]
"x-otlp-api-key" = "${OTLP_TOKEN}"

[otel.exporter."otlp-http".tls]
ca-certificate = "certs/otel-ca.pem"
client-certificate = "/etc/codex/certs/client.pem"
client-private-key = "/etc/codex/certs/client-key.pem"
```

If the exporter is `none` nothing is written anywhere; otherwise you must run or point to your
own collector. All exporters run on a background batch worker that is flushed on
shutdown.

If you build Codex from source the OTEL crate is still behind an `otel` feature
flag; the official prebuilt binaries ship with the feature enabled. When the
feature is disabled the telemetry hooks become no-ops so the CLI continues to
function without the extra dependencies.

### notify

Specify a program that will be executed to get notified about events generated by Codex. Note that the program will receive the notification argument as a string of JSON, e.g.:

```json
{
  "type": "agent-turn-complete",
  "thread-id": "b5f6c1c2-1111-2222-3333-444455556666",
  "turn-id": "12345",
  "cwd": "/Users/alice/projects/example",
  "input-messages": ["Rename `foo` to `bar` and update the callsites."],
  "last-assistant-message": "Rename complete and verified `cargo build` succeeds."
}
```

The `"type"` property will always be set. Currently, `"agent-turn-complete"` is the only notification type that is supported.

`"thread-id"` contains a string that identifies the Codex session that produced the notification; you can use it to correlate multiple turns that belong to the same task.

`"cwd"` reports the absolute working directory for the session so scripts can disambiguate which project triggered the notification.

As an example, here is a Python script that parses the JSON and decides whether to show a desktop push notification using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) on macOS:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json
import subprocess
import sys


def main() -> int:
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: notify.py <NOTIFICATION_JSON>")
        return 1

    try:
        notification = json.loads(sys.argv[1])
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return 1

    match notification_type := notification.get("type"):
        case "agent-turn-complete":
            assistant_message = notification.get("last-assistant-message")
            if assistant_message:
                title = f"Codex: {assistant_message}"
            else:
                title = "Codex: Turn Complete!"
            input_messages = notification.get("input-messages", [])
            message = " ".join(input_messages)
            title += message
        case _:
            print(f"not sending a push notification for: {notification_type}")
            return 0

    thread_id = notification.get("thread-id", "")

    subprocess.check_output(
        [
            "terminal-notifier",
            "-title",
            title,
            "-message",
            message,
            "-group",
            "codex-" + thread_id,
            "-ignoreDnD",
            "-activate",
            "com.googlecode.iterm2",
        ]
    )

    return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

In xcodex, `notify` is deprecated. To run an external program after each completed turn, configure a hook in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[hooks]
agent_turn_complete = [["python3", "/Users/mbolin/.codex/notify.py"]]
```

> [!NOTE]
> `notify` is deprecated in xcodex. Use `hooks` (below) for automation and integrations. If you only want lightweight desktop notifications while using the TUI, prefer `tui.notifications`, which uses terminal escape codes and requires no external program.

When Codex detects WSL 2 inside Windows Terminal (the session exports `WT_SESSION`), `tui.notifications` automatically switches to a Windows toast backend by spawning `powershell.exe`. This ensures both approval prompts and completed turns trigger native toasts even though Windows Terminal ignores OSC 9 escape sequences. Terminals that advertise OSC 9 support (iTerm2, WezTerm, kitty, etc.) continue to use the existing escape-sequence backend.

### hooks

`hooks` lets you run one or more external programs when Codex emits specific lifecycle events. Hooks are fire-and-forget: failures are logged and do not affect the session.

Hook commands are configured as argv arrays. Codex writes event JSON to hook stdin. For large payloads, Codex writes the full payload to a file under CODEX_HOME and writes a small JSON envelope to stdin containing `payload_path`.

Hook stdout/stderr are redirected to log files under CODEX_HOME so hooks do not interfere with the interactive TUI.

```toml
[hooks]
agent_turn_complete = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.codex/hook.py"]]
approval_requested = [["python3", "/Users/alice/.codex/hook.py"]]
```

#### hooks.command (matcher + per-hook options)

`hooks.command` is a higher-level command-hook config surface that mirrors Claude’s “event → matcher → hooks” schema while staying TOML-first in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

This is still observer-only: hook failures and outputs never block or modify the run.

Example:

```toml
[hooks.command]
default_timeout_sec = 30

[[hooks.command.tool_call_finished]]
# Recommended: match on xcodex tool ids (stable/precise).
matcher = "write_file|edit_block"
  [[hooks.command.tool_call_finished.hooks]]
  argv = ["python3", "/Users/alice/.codex/hooks/tool_call_summary.py"]

[[hooks.command.approval_requested]]
# Also accepts Claude aliases like "Bash" / "Edit" / "MCP".
matcher = "exec"
  [[hooks.command.approval_requested.hooks]]
  command = "terminal-notifier -title 'xcodex' -message 'approval requested'"
  timeout_sec = 5
```

Notes:

- `argv` is recommended; `command` is a QoL escape hatch and is executed via a shell wrapper (`bash -lc ...` / `cmd.exe /C ...`).
- `matcher` is evaluated for tool-scoped events (tool calls and approval requests). For other events, `matcher` is ignored (treated as `*`).
- `matcher` can match either:
  - xcodex tool ids (for example `write_file`, `edit_block`, `exec_command`), or
  - Claude tool-name aliases when available (for example `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`).

In xcodex, you can also enable built-in in-process (Rust) hooks.

For example, the tool-call summary hook appends compact `tool-call-finished` summaries to `CODEX_HOME/hooks-tool-calls.log`:

```toml
[hooks]
inproc = ["tool_call_summary"]
```

You can also enable `event_log_jsonl`, which appends one JSON object per hook event to `CODEX_HOME/hooks.jsonl` (same format as `examples/hooks/log_all_jsonl.py`):

```toml
[hooks]
inproc = ["event_log_jsonl"]
```

Note: `hooks.jsonl` is not automatically rotated or pruned; manage it externally if you enable this long-term.

#### hooks.host (long-lived hook host)

In addition to per-event external hooks, you can run a **long-lived hook host** process and stream hook events to it over stdin as JSONL.
This is useful for stateful hooks (e.g. Python) without per-event process spawn overhead.

The host receives one line per event:

- `type = "hook-event"`
- `event = { ... }` where `event` is the same payload object an external hook would receive on stdin (including `schema_version`, `event_id`, `timestamp`, `hook_event_name`, `xcodex_event_type`, etc.)

Example:

```toml
[hooks.host]
enabled = true
command = ["python3", "-u", "/Users/alice/.codex/hooks/host.py"]
# Optional: override the host sandbox mode (filesystem + network). When unset, the host inherits the session sandbox policy.
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
```

Notes:

- The hook host is observer-only and best-effort: failures do not fail the run.
- Events are queued with a bounded buffer; events may be dropped if the host can’t keep up.
- `sandbox_mode` controls both filesystem and network access for the host when set (no separate network toggle in v1).

For backward compatibility, you can also enable the same hook via:

```toml
[hooks]
inproc_tool_call_summary = true
```

To disable hooks for a single run (external and in-process), pass `--no-hooks`:

```sh
codex --no-hooks
codex exec --no-hooks "…"
```

To exercise your configured hook commands (both `hooks.command` and legacy `[hooks]`) with synthetic payloads (without running a full session), use:

```sh
codex hooks test external
```

Hook payloads include `"schema_version": 1`, `"event_id"`, `"timestamp"`, `"hook_event_name"`, and `"xcodex_event_type"`.
For the compatibility policy, see `docs/xcodex/hooks.md`.

Supported events:

- `agent-turn-complete`
- `approval-requested` (with `"kind"` set to `"exec"`, `"apply-patch"`, or `"elicitation"`)
- `session-start`
- `session-end`
- `user-prompt-submit`
- `pre-compact`
- `notification`
- `subagent-stop`
- `model-request-started`
- `model-response-completed`
- `tool-call-started`
- `tool-call-finished`

Note: `tool-call-started` is emitted when the tool call is dispatched; `duration_ms` in `tool-call-finished` includes any time spent queued behind non-parallel tool calls.

In the interactive TUI, quitting while hooks are still running prompts for confirmation by default. Toggle with `tui.confirm_exit_with_running_hooks`.

If `notify` is configured, Codex emits a deprecation notice and ignores it; migrate to `hooks.agent_turn_complete`.

#### Event name aliases (for hooks.command and matcher filters)

For `hooks.command` and matcher filters (`hooks.host.filters`, `hooks.pyo3.filters`), xcodex accepts several event-name aliases and maps them to the canonical xcodex events above.

Claude aliases:

- `SessionStart` → `session-start`
- `SessionEnd` → `session-end`
- `UserPromptSubmit` → `user-prompt-submit`
- `PreCompact` → `pre-compact`
- `Notification` → `notification`
- `Stop` → `agent-turn-complete`
- `SubagentStop` → `subagent-stop`
- `PermissionRequest` → `approval-requested`
- `PreToolUse` → `tool-call-started`
- `PostToolUse` → `tool-call-finished`

OpenCode aliases (quote keys containing dots in TOML):

- `"session.start"` → `session-start`
- `"session.end"` → `session-end`
- `"tool.execute.before"` → `tool-call-started`
- `"tool.execute.after"` → `tool-call-finished`
- `"tui.toast.show"` → `notification`

### hide_agent_reasoning

Codex intermittently emits "reasoning" events that show the model's internal "thinking" before it produces a final answer. Some users may find these events distracting, especially in CI logs or minimal terminal output.

Setting `hide_agent_reasoning` to `true` suppresses these events in **both** the TUI as well as the headless `exec` sub-command:

```toml
hide_agent_reasoning = true   # defaults to false
```

### show_raw_agent_reasoning

Surfaces the model’s raw chain-of-thought ("raw reasoning content") when available.

Notes:

- Only takes effect if the selected model/provider actually emits raw reasoning content. Many models do not. When unsupported, this option has no visible effect.
- Raw reasoning may include intermediate thoughts or sensitive context. Enable only if acceptable for your workflow.

Example:

```toml
show_raw_agent_reasoning = true  # defaults to false
```

## Profiles and overrides

### profiles

A _profile_ is a collection of configuration values that can be set together. Multiple profiles can be defined in `config.toml` and you can specify the one you
want to use at runtime via the `--profile` flag.

Here is an example of a `config.toml` that defines multiple profiles:

```toml
model = "o3"
approval_policy = "untrusted"

# Setting `profile` is equivalent to specifying `--profile o3` on the command
# line, though the `--profile` flag can still be used to override this value.
profile = "o3"

[model_providers.openai-chat-completions]
name = "OpenAI using Chat Completions"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "chat"

[profiles.o3]
model = "o3"
model_provider = "openai"
approval_policy = "never"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
model_reasoning_summary = "detailed"

[profiles.gpt3]
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
model_provider = "openai-chat-completions"

[profiles.zdr]
model = "o3"
model_provider = "openai"
approval_policy = "on-failure"
```

Users can specify config values at multiple levels. Order of precedence is as follows:

1. custom command-line argument, e.g., `--model o3`
2. as part of a profile, where the `--profile` is specified via a CLI (or in the config file itself)
3. as an entry in `config.toml`, e.g., `model = "o3"`
4. the default value that comes with Codex CLI (i.e., Codex CLI defaults to `gpt-5.1-codex-max`)

### history

By default, Codex CLI records messages sent to the model in `$CODEX_HOME/history.jsonl`. Note that on UNIX, the file permissions are set to `o600`, so it should only be readable and writable by the owner.

To disable this behavior, configure `[history]` as follows:

```toml
[history]
persistence = "none"  # "save-all" is the default value
```

To cap the size of `history.jsonl`, set `history.max_bytes` to a positive byte
count. When the file grows beyond the limit, Codex removes the oldest entries,
compacting the file down to roughly 80% of the hard cap while keeping the newest
record intact. Omitting the option—or setting it to `0`—disables pruning.

### file_opener

Identifies the editor/URI scheme to use for hyperlinking citations in model output. If set, citations to files in the model output will be hyperlinked using the specified URI scheme so they can be ctrl/cmd-clicked from the terminal to open them.

For example, if the model output includes a reference such as `【F:/home/user/project/main.py†L42-L50】`, then this would be rewritten to link to the URI `vscode://file/home/user/project/main.py:42`.

Note this is **not** a general editor setting (like `$EDITOR`), as it only accepts a fixed set of values:

- `"vscode"` (default)
- `"vscode-insiders"`
- `"windsurf"`
- `"cursor"`
- `"none"` to explicitly disable this feature

Currently, `"vscode"` is the default, though Codex does not verify VS Code is installed. As such, `file_opener` may default to `"none"` or something else in the future.

### project_doc_max_bytes

Maximum number of bytes to read from an `AGENTS.md` file to include in the instructions sent with the first turn of a session. Defaults to 32 KiB.

### project_doc_fallback_filenames

Ordered list of additional filenames to look for when `AGENTS.md` is missing at a given directory level. The CLI always checks `AGENTS.md` first; the configured fallbacks are tried in the order provided. This lets monorepos that already use alternate instruction files (for example, `CLAUDE.md`) work out of the box while you migrate to `AGENTS.md` over time.

```toml
project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md", ".exampleagentrules.md"]
```

We recommend migrating instructions to AGENTS.md; other filenames may reduce model performance.

> See also [AGENTS.md discovery](./agents_md.md) for how Codex locates these files during a session.

### tui

Options that are specific to the TUI.

```toml
[tui]
# Send desktop notifications when approvals are required or a turn completes.
# Defaults to true.
notifications = true

# You can optionally filter to specific notification types.
# Available types are "agent-turn-complete" and "approval-requested".
notifications = [ "agent-turn-complete", "approval-requested" ]

# Disable terminal animations (welcome screen, status shimmer, spinner).
# Defaults to true.
animations = false

# Footer status bar items. Defaults to false.
status_bar_show_git_branch = false
status_bar_show_worktree = false

# TUI2 mouse scrolling (wheel + trackpad)
#
# Terminals emit different numbers of raw scroll events per physical wheel notch (commonly 1, 3,
# or 9+). TUI2 normalizes raw event density into consistent wheel behavior (default: ~3 lines per
# wheel notch) while keeping trackpad input higher fidelity via fractional accumulation.
#
# See `codex-rs/tui2/docs/scroll_input_model.md` for the model and probe data.

# Override *wheel* event density (raw events per physical wheel notch). TUI2 only.
#
# Wheel-like per-event contribution is:
# - `scroll_wheel_lines / scroll_events_per_tick`
#
# Trackpad-like streams use `min(scroll_events_per_tick, 3)` as the divisor so dense wheel ticks
# (e.g. 9 events per notch) do not make trackpads feel artificially slow.
scroll_events_per_tick = 3

# Override wheel scroll lines per physical wheel notch (classic feel). TUI2 only.
scroll_wheel_lines = 3

# Override baseline trackpad sensitivity (lines per tick-equivalent). TUI2 only.
#
# Trackpad-like per-event contribution is:
# - `scroll_trackpad_lines / min(scroll_events_per_tick, 3)`
scroll_trackpad_lines = 1

# Trackpad acceleration (optional). TUI2 only.
# These keep small swipes precise while letting large/faster swipes cover more content.
#
# Concretely, TUI2 computes:
# - `multiplier = clamp(1 + abs(events) / scroll_trackpad_accel_events, 1..scroll_trackpad_accel_max)`
#
# The multiplier is applied to the trackpad-like stream’s computed line delta (including any
# carried fractional remainder).
scroll_trackpad_accel_events = 30
scroll_trackpad_accel_max = 3

# Force scroll interpretation. TUI2 only.
# Valid values: "auto" (default), "wheel", "trackpad"
scroll_mode = "auto"

# Auto-mode heuristic tuning. TUI2 only.
scroll_wheel_tick_detect_max_ms = 12
scroll_wheel_like_max_duration_ms = 200

# Invert scroll direction for mouse wheel/trackpad. TUI2 only.
scroll_invert = false
```

> [!NOTE]
> Codex emits desktop notifications using terminal escape codes. Not all terminals support these (notably, macOS Terminal.app and VS Code's terminal do not support custom notifications. iTerm2, Ghostty and WezTerm do support these notifications).

> [!NOTE] > `tui.notifications` is built‑in and limited to the TUI session. For programmatic or cross‑environment notifications—or to integrate with OS‑specific notifiers—use the top‑level `notify` option to run an external program that receives event JSON. The two settings are independent and can be used together.

Scroll settings (`tui.scroll_events_per_tick`, `tui.scroll_wheel_lines`, `tui.scroll_trackpad_lines`, `tui.scroll_trackpad_accel_*`, `tui.scroll_mode`, `tui.scroll_wheel_*`, `tui.scroll_invert`) currently apply to the TUI2 viewport scroll implementation.

> [!NOTE] > `tui.scroll_events_per_tick` has terminal-specific defaults derived from mouse scroll probe logs
> collected on macOS for a small set of terminals:
>
> - Terminal.app: 3
> - Warp: 9
> - WezTerm: 1
> - Alacritty: 3
> - Ghostty: 3 (stopgap; one probe measured ~9)
> - iTerm2: 1
> - VS Code terminal: 1
> - Kitty: 3
>
> We should augment these defaults with data from more terminals and other platforms over time.
> Unknown terminals fall back to 3 and can be overridden via `tui.scroll_events_per_tick`.

## Authentication and authorization

### Forcing a login method

To force users on a given machine to use a specific login method or workspace, use a combination of [managed configurations](https://developers.openai.com/codex/security#managed-configuration) as well as either or both of the following fields:

```toml
# Force the user to log in with ChatGPT or via an api key.
forced_login_method = "chatgpt" or "api"
# When logging in with ChatGPT, only the specified workspace ID will be presented during the login
# flow and the id will be validated during the oauth callback as well as every time Codex starts.
forced_chatgpt_workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

If the active credentials don't match the config, the user will be logged out and Codex will exit.

If `forced_chatgpt_workspace_id` is set but `forced_login_method` is not set, API key login will still work.

### Control where login credentials are stored

```toml
cli_auth_credentials_store = "keyring"
```

Valid values:

- `file` (default) – Store credentials in `auth.json` under `$CODEX_HOME`.
- `keyring` – Store credentials in the operating system keyring via the [`keyring` crate](https://crates.io/crates/keyring); the CLI reports an error if secure storage is unavailable. Backends by OS:
  - macOS: macOS Keychain
  - Windows: Windows Credential Manager
  - Linux: DBus‑based Secret Service, the kernel keyutils, or a combination
  - FreeBSD/OpenBSD: DBus‑based Secret Service
- `auto` – Save credentials to the operating system keyring when available; otherwise, fall back to `auth.json` under `$CODEX_HOME`.

## JSON Schema

The generated JSON Schema for `config.toml` lives at `codex-rs/core/config.schema.json`.

## Notices

Codex stores "do not show again" flags for some UI prompts under the `[notice]` table.

Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D quitting uses a ~1 second double-press hint (`ctrl + c again to quit`).
