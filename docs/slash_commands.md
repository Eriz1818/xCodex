### xcodex additions

If you're using `xcodex`, run:

- `/help xcodex` — quick index of xcodex-only features available in your current UI.
- `/xtreme` — open the ⚡Tools control panel (same view as `Ctrl+O`, tools-first).
- `/ps` and `/ps-kill` — background terminals (availability may depend on UI frontend); see `docs/xcodex/background-terminals.md`.

More xcodex docs:

- `docs/xcodex/README.md`
- `docs/xcodex/settings.md`
- `docs/xcodex/worktrees.md`

Worktree helpers (xcodex):

- `/worktree shared add|rm|list` — edit `worktrees.shared_dirs` from inside the TUI (no manual `config.toml` edit).
